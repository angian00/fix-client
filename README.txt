Chess. Real-time, on the Internet. From an iPad. For free.
FICS (Free Internet Chess Server: http://freechess.org) is great.
iPad is great.
But these two worlds have yet to meet in heaven.

The platform of choice for playing chess even half-seriously is FICS (http://freechess.org) -- or its for-profit counterparts, but I don't care about them.
It's robust, it's alive since the '90s. It's free.
It has all you might fancy: ratings, tournaments, time-controls, people playing 24/7, chat... You name it.

Lots of FICS GUIs have been developed over the years, both for PCs and Linuxes/OSX, most of them free and/or Open Source.
Search around and you'll find them.

Some GUIs have been developed for iOS, but mostly for the iPhone.
There is not a eye-pleasing, free, not-buggy client exploting all the screen real estate provided the iPad.

My aim is to build one. And gift it to the world.

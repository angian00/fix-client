fics% help style

Usage: style n

  Sets your 'style' variable to n.  Equivalent to "set style n".  This command
allows you to choose among the various board display options.
 
 1.   Standard ICS board in ascii format (default)
 2.   USA-Today Sports Center-style board
 3.   Experimental vt-100 ANSI board for dark backgrounds
 4.   Experimental vt-100 ANSI board for light backgrounds
 5.   Style suggested by ajpierce@med.unc.edu
 6.   Email Board suggested by Thomas Fought (tlf@rsch.oclc.org)
 7.   Miniature board
 8.   ICS interface maker board -- raw data dump
 9.   last 2 moves only (previous non-verbose mode)
10.   Alternate raw dump
11.   Same as 8, but with verbose moves ("P/e3-e4", instead of "e4")
12.   Similar to style 10  [see "help style12" for details on this style]
13.   Displays board in color for SGI machines -- white versus purple pieces
      with purple and black squares (for b/w monitors it would display as bold
      and regular).

  Some graphics interfaces work only with specific board styles.  Determine
which one is best for your set up.

  Suggestions on different styles are always welcome.

fics% help style12

 Style 12 is a type of machine parseable output that many of the FICS
interfaces use.  The output is documented here for those who wish to write new
interfaces.  Style 12 is also fully compatible with ICC (The Internet Chess
Club).

  The data is all on one line (displayed here as two lines, so it will show on
your screen).  Here is an example:  [Note: the beginning and ending quotation
marks are *not* part of the data string; they are needed in this help file
because some interfaces cannot display the string when in a text file.]

"<12> rnbqkb-r pppppppp -----n-- -------- ----P--- -------- PPPPKPPP RNBQ-BNR
 B -1 0 0 1 1 0 7 Newton Einstein 1 2 12 39 39 119 122 2 K/e1-e2 (0:06) Ke2 0"

This string always begins on a new line, and there are always exactly 31 non-
empty fields separated by blanks. The fields are:

* the string "<12>" to identify this line.
* eight fields representing the board position.  The first one is White's
  8th rank (also Black's 1st rank), then White's 7th rank (also Black's 2nd),
  etc, regardless of who's move it is.
* color whose turn it is to move ("B" or "W")
* -1 if the previous move was NOT a double pawn push, otherwise the chess 
  board file  (numbered 0--7 for a--h) in which the double push was made
* can White still castle short? (0=no, 1=yes)
* can White still castle long?
* can Black still castle short?
* can Black still castle long?
* the number of moves made since the last irreversible move.  (0 if last move
  was irreversible.  If the value is >= 100, the game can be declared a draw
  due to the 50 move rule.)
* The game number
* White's name
* Black's name
* my relation to this game:
    -3 isolated position, such as for "ref 3" or the "sposition" command
    -2 I am observing game being examined
     2 I am the examiner of this game
    -1 I am playing, it is my opponent's move
     1 I am playing and it is my move
     0 I am observing a game being played
* initial time (in seconds) of the match
* increment In seconds) of the match
* White material strength
* Black material strength
* White's remaining time
* Black's remaining time
* the number of the move about to be made (standard chess numbering -- White's
  and Black's first moves are both 1, etc.)
* verbose coordinate notation for the previous move ("none" if there were
  none) [note this used to be broken for examined games]
* time taken to make previous move "(min:sec)".
* pretty notation for the previous move ("none" if there is none)
* flip field for board orientation: 1 = Black at bottom, 0 = White at bottom.

In the future, new fields may be added to the end of the data string, so
programs should parse from left to right.

Special information for bughouse games
--------------------------------------

When showing positions from bughouse games, a second line showing piece
holding is given, with "<b1>" at the beginning, for example:

  <b1> game 6 white [PNBBB] black [PNB]

Also, when pieces are "passed" during bughouse, a short data string -- not the
entire board position -- is sent.  For example:

  <b1> game 52 white [NB] black [N] <- BN

The final two letters indicate the piece that was passed; in the above
example, a knight (N) was passed to Black.

A prompt may preceed the <b1> header.

Credits
-------

  Style12 was designed by Daniel Sleator (sleator+@cs.cmu.edu) (Darooha@ICC)

  A big thanks to ICC for letting us use the specification document as the
basis for this helpfile.  There are only a couple of modifications to the
document to use FICS terminology.

  This helpfile may be used by others as long as the credit to ICC above
remains.

fics% help iv_compressmove

  Setting ivariable compressmove will generate 'delta' boards on certain moves.
These delta boards are smaller than normal style 12 boards and make it quicker
to get the data in and involves less transfer for the server.

  Delta boards will NOT be shown in the following circumstances and a full
board will be shown instead:

  Once only showing of the board (eg. refresh or sposition)
  Setup, examined, crazyhouse, wild, bughouse, suicide games
  Rejected move boards
  Paused or unpaused, taken back or switched games
  First board of a game / observed game or adjourned game restarted
  Simul holder goes to a board
  Clock setting refreshes

  (Items may be added or removed from this list)

  A delta board appears as follows:

- <d1> game_index num_half_moves algebraic_string smith_string time_taken_in_ms
       time_left_in_ms

  (note the - was added so as not to confuse interfaces displaying this
   helpfile)

For example:

- <d1> 2 64 Rxc2 e2c2p 1200 203800

num_half_moves is the number of half moves played
smith_string is <square><square><info chars> where <info> is:

  '' no info
  q,r,n,b,k,p captured (note k is suicide only which will not be shown)
  Q,R,N,B,K promoted (note K is suicide only which will not be shown)
  c - O-O occurred (depending on the game type what happens)
  C - O-O-O occurred (depending on the game type what happens)
  E - en-passant capture

Example moves are:

e2e4 - piece moves from e2 to e4
g8f6n - piece moves from g8 to f6 capturing a knight
e1g1c - O-O occurred
e8c8C - O-O-O occurred
e5d6E - en-passant capture
b7a8rQ - piece moves from b7 to a8 capturing a rook and promoting to a queen

  Note any new fields will be appended to the end so the interface must be
able to handle this.
